Notes on packages:
	EndOfTheCycle is the default package. Don't use it for anything particularly interesting
	EC_Engine is the package that contains the unreal interfaces and control logic
	EC_Framework is the package that contains fundamental gameplay mechanics such as Work, Units, Entities, Mission, as well as map types, ...
	EC_Game is the package that contains the high-level templates, such as research / construction work / enemies, ...
	maybe make a separate package for generic UI?

The Highlander is a git submodule.
The master branch of the submodule is what we are working with, the ec_dev branch has only ec_specific changes. They are merged into master afterwards.
